# tree-counting
Project using drone imagery and counting the number of trees in an orthoimage

## Collaborators
Ben Thompson, Cayden Doherty, Finn Olson, Josh Mason

## Description
We did this project as a self-guided final for Geography 489 - Mapping with Drones at the University of Oregon. For this project, our group travelled to Baumann Tree farm in Lane County, Oregon and collected over 100 drone images of the landscape. From there, we processed the imagery in Agisoft Metashape and made an orthomosaic. With that orthomosaic, we used a variety of methods to count the number of trees in the farm, or at least the segment that we observed for our project. These methods included manual counting (to use as reference), a pre-trained neural network, ArcGIS calculate geometry tool, and calculating points from a created Lidar point cloud
